- **Xamarin**: C# (Microsoft)
- **Pros**: Single codebase, faster development
- **Cons**: Platform limitations, performance trade-offs

### Why Flutter?

Flutter has emerged as the leading cross-platform framework:

✅ **Single Codebase**: Write once, run on iOS and Android  
✅ **Native Performance**: Compiles to native code
