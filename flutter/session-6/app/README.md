- **Data Collection**: Save all form data with one call
- **Form Management**: Reset, validate, and save operations

**Key Concepts:**

- Form widget architecture
- GlobalKey usage and benefits
- form.validate() and form.save() methods
- onSaved callbacks for data collection
- Centralized form state management

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Registration Form Solution (`4_registration_form_solution.dart`)

**Complete Homework Implementation**

See the complete solution for the registration form homework:

- **All Required Fields**: Name, email, password, country, terms
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Professional validation rules
- **Custom Checkbox Validation**: Non-TextFormField validation
- **Professional UI**: Loading states, success feedback, form reset
- **Best Practices**: Clean code, proper disposal, error handling

**Key Concepts:**

- Complete form implementation
- Custom validation strategies

## üöÄ Getting Started Guide

### For Instructors

1. **Start with Form Widgets Demo**

   - Show different input widget types
   - Explain the "forms as surveys" analogy
   - Demonstrate individual state management

2. **Move to Text Validation**

   - Introduce TextFormField vs TextField
   - Show validation function patterns
   - Demonstrate professional input handling

3. **Explain Form Widget**

   - Introduce the "team captain" concept
   - Show GlobalKey usage and benefits
   - Demonstrate centralized form management

4. **Assign Homework**
   - Use registration form as homework
   - Students build complete form from scratch
   - Solution available for reference

### For Students

1. **Explore Each Workshop**

   - Run each demo and interact with the forms
   - Study the code to understand patterns
   - Note the progression in complexity

2. **Practice Building Forms**

   - Start with simple single-field forms
   - Add validation to your forms
   - Practice using Form widget with GlobalKey

3. **Complete Homework**
   - Build the registration form from scratch
   - Implement all required validation
   - Focus on user experience

```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Validation not working"**

- Make sure you're using `TextFormField`, not `TextField`
- Check that validator returns `null` for valid input
- Ensure you're calling `form.validate()` on submission

**"Controllers not disposing"**

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  _controller.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

**"Form not resetting"**

```dart
// Reset form state
_formKey.currentState!.reset();

// Clear controllers manually if needed
_controller.clear();
```

**"Checkbox validation not working"**

- `CheckboxListTile` doesn't have a `validator` property
- Handle validation manually in your submit method
- Check the state before calling `form.validate()`

### Performance Tips

- Always dispose TextEditingControllers
- Use appropriate keyboard types for better UX
- Implement loading states for better perceived performance
- Validate on submission, not on every keystroke (unless needed)

## üéØ Workshop Objectives Checklist
