### For Students

1. **Explore Each Workshop**

   - Run each demo and interact with the UI
   - Study the code to understand patterns
   - Note the progression from basic to advanced concepts

2. **Practice Building APIs**

   - Start with simple HTTP requests
   - Add proper error handling
   - Create your own data models
   - Build complete apps with FutureBuilder

3. **Complete the Homework**
   - Build the photo gallery app from scratch
   - Use the solution as a reference, not a copy
   - Add your own creative features

## üîß Dependencies

This project uses the following packages:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8
  http: ^1.1.0 # For HTTP requests

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^5.0.0
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Package http not found"**

- Make sure you've run `flutter pub get`
- Check that http: ^1.1.0 is in your pubspec.yaml dependencies

**"Network request failed"**

- Check your internet connection
- Ensure the API endpoint is correct
- Look for CORS issues in web builds

**"JSON parsing error"**

- Verify the API response format
- Check your model class fromJson implementation
- Handle null values properly with ?? operator

**"FutureBuilder not updating"**

- Make sure you're using setState() to update the Future
- Don't create new Futures in the build method
- Initialize Future in initState() or with late keyword

**"Images not loading"**

- Check image URLs are valid
- Implement proper errorBuilder for Image.network
- Handle network connectivity issues

### Performance Tips

- **Limit API Results**: Use query parameters to limit large responses
- **Cache Images**: Consider using cached_network_image package
- **Debounce Requests**: Avoid making too many rapid API calls
- **Handle Large Lists**: Use ListView.builder for large datasets
