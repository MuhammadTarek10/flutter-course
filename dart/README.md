# Session 1: Dart Fundamentals

Welcome to Session 1 of your Flutter course! This session focuses on mastering the fundamentals of Dart programming language, which is essential for Flutter development.

## üìö Session Overview

In this session, you'll learn:

- Basic Dart syntax and concepts
- Variables, functions, and control structures
- Data structures (Lists and Maps)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Practical application through a calculator project

## üóÇÔ∏è Session Structure

### 1. Getting Started with Dart

**Location**: `1. getting-started/`

**What you'll learn**:

- Variables and data types
- Functions and parameters
- Control structures (if statements)
- Loops (for and while loops)

**Key Concepts**:

- Basic syntax and structure
- Function declaration and calling
- Variable declaration and usage
- Conditional logic
- Iteration

**Run the code**:

```bash
cd "1. getting-started"
dart main.dart
```

---

### 2. Data Structures

**Location**: `2. data-structures/`

**What you'll learn**:

- Lists and their operations
- Maps (key-value pairs)
- Iterating through collections

**Key Concepts**:

- Collection types in Dart
- Generic types (`List<int>`, `Map<int, String>`)
- For-in loops for iteration
- Data organization and storage

**Run the code**:

```bash
cd "2. data-structures"
dart main.dart
```

---

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Location**: `3. oop/`

**What you'll learn**:

- Class definition and structure
- Constructors
- Methods and properties
- Object instantiation
- Method overriding

**Key Concepts**:

- Class-based programming
- Encapsulation
- Constructor syntax
- Method implementation
- `toString()` method override

**Run the code**:

```bash
cd "3. oop"
dart main.dart
```

---

### 4. Calculator Project

**Location**: `4. calculator/`

**What you'll learn**:

- Practical application of all concepts
- User input and output
- Error handling
- Real-world problem solving

**Project Requirements**:

- Create a `Calculator` class with methods for each operation
- Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handle user input and display results
- Implement error handling for edge cases

**Files**:

- `task.md` - Complete project requirements and specifications
- `solution/` - Reference implementation (check after completing your own!)

**Your Task**:

1. Read the `task.md` file carefully
2. Implement your own calculator solution
3. Test with various inputs including edge cases
4. Compare with the solution implementation

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

‚úÖ **Understand Dart syntax and structure**  
‚úÖ **Write functions with parameters and return values**  
‚úÖ **Use control structures and loops effectively**  
‚úÖ **Work with Lists and Maps**  
‚úÖ **Create classes and objects**  
‚úÖ **Implement basic error handling**  
‚úÖ **Build a complete program from requirements**

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Dart SDK installed
2. **Order**: Follow the modules in sequence (1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4)
3. **Practice**: Run each example and experiment with the code
4. **Project**: Complete the calculator project independently
5. **Review**: Check the solution after completing your implementation

## üí° Tips for Success

- **Experiment**: Modify the example code to understand concepts better
- **Take Notes**: Document new concepts and syntax patterns
- **Practice**: Write additional small programs to reinforce learning
- **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to seek clarification on concepts
- **Complete the Project**: The calculator project is crucial for practical application
