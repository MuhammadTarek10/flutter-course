# Dart Calculator

## Task Description

Create a simple calculator program in Dart. Your calculator should be able to perform the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Requirements

- **Use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - Create a `Calculator` class that contains methods for each operation.
- **Use Functions:**
  - Each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) should be implemented as a separate method inside the class.
- **User Input:**
  - The program should prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, \*, /).
- **Output:**
  - Display the result of the operation.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Handle division by zero and invalid operators gracefully.

## Example Input/Output

**Input:**

```
Enter first number: 8
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5
```

**Output:**

```
Result: 40
```

**Input:**

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): /
Enter second number: 0
```

**Output:**

```
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
```

**Goal:**

- Practice using classes and functions in Dart.
- Learn how to handle user input and output.
- Understand basic error handling.
